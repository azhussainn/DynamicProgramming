# DynamicProgramming

Dynamic Programming is the application of memoization to recursion. Dp can also be used iteratively.

To apply dynamic programming in a problem you need the following:

1. To find the recurrance relation.
2. A base case
3. Most importantly, if there are repeating sub problems in your problem.
4. And a way to store previous Result i.e a dp_Array, or a dictionary etc.
